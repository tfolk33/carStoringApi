Feedback on the project:
  
This was a very interesting exercise that gave me a sneak peek into the complex situations that Neighbor faces when fitting customers' unique needs. I put myself in the customers' shoes and assumed they would appreciate storing multiple cars in a single space if there was enough room.

Thinking through the many possible ways to tackle this problem was truly a great problem-solving challenge. I believe my solution is fast and practical, given the time constraints, and it demonstrates my ability to think through various aspects of a technical project.

I chose to implement this API with FastAPI because it is highly performant and offers excellent features that save time and improve efficiency. Likewise, I used Vercel to deploy the API, as it is a stable, fast, and easy-to-use web deployment platform.

It is very satisfying to see low-cost options for users who want to store their cars, as well as imagining listers being excited that their extra space is turning into income for them!
