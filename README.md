- Feedback on the project
This was a very interesting exercise that gave me a sneak peek into the complex situations that Neighbor faces to fit the customers unique needs. I put myself in the customers shoes and made the assumption that they would appreciate storing multiple cars in a single space, if there was enough room. Thinking through as many of the possible ways to tackle this problem truly was a great problem solving challenge, as there are many. I beleive that my solution is fast and practicle, given the time constraints, and demonstrates my ability to think through many aspects of a technical project. I choose to implement this api with FastAPI as it is very performant and offers really nice features to save time and efficiency. Likewise, I am using Vercel to deploy the API, which is a very stable, fast, and easy to use web deployment platform. It is very satisfying to see low cost options for the user wanting to store their cars, as well as imaging the lister being excited their extra space is turning into income for them!
